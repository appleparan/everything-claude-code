# Code Review Standards

Review code after writing or modifying it, before commits to shared
branches, and always when the change touches security-sensitive areas
(auth, payments, user data) or system architecture. Before requesting
review, make sure automated checks pass, conflicts are resolved, and
the branch is up to date with its target.

Lead with risks — vulnerabilities, failure modes, and defects —
before any positive commentary; this applies to design reviews as
much as to code.

## Severity Levels

| Level | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| CRITICAL | Security vulnerability or data-loss risk | Block — fix before merge |
| HIGH | Bug or significant quality issue | Fix before merge |
| MEDIUM | Maintainability concern | Fix when possible |
| LOW | Style or minor suggestion | Optional |

Approve with no CRITICAL or HIGH issues; block on CRITICAL.

## How to Review

Use the `/code-review` command or the **code-reviewer** agent for
general review. Bring in the **security-reviewer** agent (or the
`security-review` skill) whenever the change touches authentication,
user input handling, database queries, file system operations,
external API calls, cryptography, or payments. Language-specific
reviewers exist for TypeScript, Python, Go, and Rust.

When the Codex CLI and the openai-codex plugin are installed, the
`/code-review` command also runs a Codex review in parallel and merges
both result sets into one severity-ordered report, tagging each
finding with its source (`[Claude]`, `[Codex]`, `[Both]`). Blocking
rules apply equally to findings from either reviewer. Without Codex,
`/code-review` falls back to the Claude-only review. For manual Codex
reviews, use `/codex:review` or `/codex:adversarial-review`.

Detailed checklists live with the tools that apply them: the
code-review command, the security-review skill,
[security.md](security.md) for the pre-commit security list, and
[testing.md](testing.md) for coverage expectations.

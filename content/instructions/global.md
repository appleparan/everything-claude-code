# Development Guidelines

## Language

- **Code, commits, PR/MR**: English
- **Conversation with user**: Korean

## Model Delegation

For all coding tasks, use your judgment to decide an appropriate
lower-power model (e.g. sonnet/haiku) and run the task in a subagent
with that model, reserving the top-tier model for planning and review.

## Before Writing Code

Read the affected area first and match the project's existing
conventions, patterns, and idioms. If a local `CLAUDE.md` or style
guide exists, follow it. Verify assumptions against the code instead
of guessing.

## Git Workflow

- All work happens on a branch (`<type>/<short-description>`; types:
  feat, fix, refactor, docs, test, chore, perf, ci) in a git worktree
  under `.claude/` — never edit the main checkout directly. Parallel
  sessions without isolation cause conflicts.
- Pull/rebase `origin/main` before starting doc or code work.
- Commit at the end of every meaningful stage, not all at once at the
  end.
- **Get explicit user confirmation before creating a PR/MR** (GitHub:
  `gh`, GitLab: `glab`). When no forge is available, the same rule
  applies to merging the branch into main.

## Planning

Plan before implementing: understand the actual problem, the affected
code, and the risks; prefer the simplest approach that works. For
non-trivial work, write the plan to `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` in the
worktree root and keep its status current; before removing it, record
a summary (stages, key decisions, verification results) in the issue
or PR — or, when no forge is available, in the change's
`docs/changes/` record. The `ship` skill covers the full plan →
issue → worktree → TDD → PR flow, including the local record
fallback (`Change:` commit trailers + `docs/changes/` documents)
used when `gh`/`glab` are unavailable.

## Design Decisions

For architecture and design choices, present at least two options
with trade-offs and cost rationale, give a recommendation, and let
the user make the final call. Never state unverified external facts
(prices, quotas, SLAs, version-specific behavior) as certain — mark
them "needs verification" and back service specs and limits with
official documentation links.

## Quality Gate

Use the project's own lint/format/type-check/test commands and run
them against the whole project, not single files. Write or update
tests for changed behavior when test infrastructure exists; otherwise
document manual verification steps and outcomes. Run long test
commands with explicit single-run flags (e.g. `vitest run`), never in
watch mode.

## Debugging

Base bug fixes on empirical evidence (logs, repro) before proposing a
root cause. State the hypothesis and test it before implementing the
fix.

- Present causes only as hypothesis + verification method, never as
  conclusions.
- Quote findings from logs/config verbatim with line numbers.
- Prefer read-only verification commands (describe, logs, get); ask
  before running anything that changes state.
- To revisit a hypothesis the user has ruled out, present new
  evidence first.
- Record ruled-out hypotheses with the evidence that eliminated them
  (e.g. "suspected DNS, but resolve times were normal — ruled out").
  The elimination trail shows systematic narrowing and matters as much
  as the answer itself.
- Once the root cause is found, include recurrence prevention — even
  one line (monitoring, alerting, config change). Debugging ends when
  the issue can't happen again, not when it's fixed.

## Safety

- Never include destructive commands (`rm -rf`,
  `git worktree remove --force`) in subagent prompts or automated
  steps; confirm with the user before any cleanup or deletion.
- Never bypass commit hooks (`--no-verify`), disable tests instead of
  fixing them, or commit code that doesn't compile.

## When Stuck

After 3 failed attempts, stop and report: what you tried and why it
failed, plus 2–3 alternative approaches. Ask for direction before
continuing.
